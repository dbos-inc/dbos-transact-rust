//! The DBOS Rust starter: the Workflows, Queues, Events and Messages tabs of the starter app.
//!
//! **Workflows** is three steps, five seconds each, a progress event after each — and a crash
//! button. Launch a workflow, crash the process, restart it, and watch execution resume at the
//! step after the last one that finished. Durable execution is the whole demo: the crash-and-resume
//! needs no application code at all, because `launch()` recovers whatever the previous run
//! abandoned.
//!
//! **Events** is a key/value a workflow publishes as it goes, and anyone reads by name. The
//! Workflows tab already leans on one event for its progress bar; what this tab adds is the half
//! that bar cannot show — a read that *waits*. Ask for `shipped` before the order has shipped and
//! the request blocks until the workflow publishes it, which is `get_event` with a timeout rather
//! than the zero-timeout poll the progress bar uses.
//!
//! **Messages** is a workflow that stops and waits to be told something. An approval request runs
//! until it reaches `recv`, and then nothing happens until a message arrives — from this tab, from
//! another process, or from an application in another language. Approve one and it is `send`;
//! approve every waiting one and it is `send_bulk`, which is one transaction and so all-or-nothing.
//!
//! **Queues** is a fan-out under a concurrency limit. Enqueue five workflows that sleep five
//! seconds each against a queue allowing three at a time, and watch three run while two wait. The
//! part worth pressing is the Apply button: `worker_concurrency` changes while the app is running,
//! because a queue's configuration is a row every worker re-reads on every pass rather than a
//! constant captured at startup.
