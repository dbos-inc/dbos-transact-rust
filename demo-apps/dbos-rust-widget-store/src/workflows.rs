//! The two workflows the storefront runs.
//!
//! **The demo is the crash button.** Buy a widget, and while the order is being dispatched, kill
//! the process. Start it again and the order carries on arriving from where it stopped — no
//! application code takes part in that, because `launch()` recovers whatever the previous run
//! abandoned and each step replays from its checkpoint rather than running again.
//!
//! The checkout is the interesting half. It reserves inventory, then *stops* and waits to be told
//! whether the card was charged — a wait that outlives the process, because the deadline is a row
//! rather than a timer in memory. Whichever way the answer goes, the workflow is what guarantees
//! the books balance: a payment that fails puts the widget back on the shelf, and a payment that
//! never comes does the same when the deadline passes.
