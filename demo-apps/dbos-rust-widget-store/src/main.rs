//! The widget store: an online storefront that survives being killed mid-checkout.
//!
//! Buy a widget and watch the order go out. Then press the crash button — at any point, including
//! halfway through a dispatch — and start the app again. The order resumes from the last step that
//! finished, and nothing here does anything to make that happen: `launch()` recovers what the
//! previous run abandoned, and a step that finished replays from its checkpoint rather than
//! running a second time.
//!
//! A step *interrupted* mid-write is the exception, and `store.rs` is where it is spelled out: its
//! checkpoint and its row are two separate commits while Rust has no transactional step, so those
//! writes are at-least-once and a badly timed crash can miscount the inventory.
//!
//! The Rust port of the widget store that already exists in Python, TypeScript, Go and Java. Same
//! application schema, same HTTP surface, same frontend, so the five can be read against each
//! other — see `src/workflows.rs`, which is the part worth reading.
