# DBOS Rust Widget Store

An online storefront that survives being killed mid-checkout. Buy a widget and watch the order go
out; press the crash button at any point — including halfway through a dispatch — and start the app
again. The order resumes from the last step that finished.

No application code takes part in that recovery. `launch()` picks up whatever the previous run
abandoned, and a step that finished replays from its checkpoint instead of running a second time.
A step that was *interrupted* runs again, which for the writes here means at-least-once rather than
exactly-once — see the note on transactional steps below for what that costs.

This is the Rust port of the widget store that already exists in Python, TypeScript, Go and Java.

## Running it

You need a PostgreSQL server. With Docker:

```bash
docker run -d --name widget-store-pg -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=dbos -p 5432:5432 postgres:17
export DBOS_DATABASE_URL="postgres://postgres:dbos@localhost:5432/dbos_rust_widget_store"
```

Then:

```bash
cargo run -p dbos-rust-widget-store
```

The app serves at http://localhost:8080. It creates the database, the DBOS system tables, and its
own `products` and `orders` tables on first run — there is nothing to migrate by hand.

Without `DBOS_DATABASE_URL` it falls back to `postgres://localhost:5432/dbos_rust_widget_store`,
letting the standard libpq variables (`PGUSER`, `PGPASSWORD`) fill in the rest.

## What to try

1. **Buy a widget.** Inventory drops, the order goes to PAID, and the progress bar walks it out
   over ten seconds.
2. **Crash it mid-dispatch.** Press the crash button while the bar is moving. Restart the app and
   watch the same order carry on from where it stopped, then reach DISPATCHED.
3. **Decline a payment.** The widget goes back on the shelf and the order is CANCELLED — the
   compensation the reservation was taken out against.
4. **Double-click Buy.** One order, not two: the browser's idempotency key is the workflow id, so
   the second request joins the checkout already running.

## What is worth reading

[`src/workflows.rs`](src/workflows.rs) is the demo. Two workflows:

- **`checkout`** reserves a widget, then *stops* and waits to be told whether the card was charged.
  That wait outlives the process, because the deadline is a row rather than a timer in memory.
  Either answer leaves the books balanced: a payment that fails puts the widget back, and so does a
  payment that never comes.
- **`dispatch_order`** is a child workflow, started and not awaited, so the buyer is not kept
  waiting for ten seconds of delivery. Being a child rather than a spawned task is what makes it
  survive a restart.

[`src/store.rs`](src/store.rs) holds the plain SQL, and [`src/main.rs`](src/main.rs) the HTTP
surface.

## A note on transactional steps

Rust does not have transactional steps yet. Every database write here runs inside an ordinary
`dbos::step`, so the step's checkpoint and the row it writes are **two separate commits** rather
than one. A crash in the window between them replays a step whose write already committed, so the
inventory decrement, its compensating increment and the order insert are each **at-least-once**: a
badly timed crash can take two widgets off the shelf for one order, put one back twice, or leave a
second order stranded at PENDING. The other four widget stores use a transactional step for these
and have no such window; this is the one place the ports differ.

The gap closes when Rust gains datasources and the transactional step built on them, which commit
the application write and the step's checkpoint together. Until then the demo leaves the window
open rather than hiding it behind hand-rolled idempotency keys, because what it exists to show is
recovery — the workflow resuming mid-checkout across a process death — and an honest note costs
less than machinery that obscures the mechanism.
